# Simon Says Game

A classic memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Test your memory by repeating increasingly complex sequences of colored buttons!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click the **"Start Game"** button to begin
2. Watch as Simon shows you a sequence of colored buttons
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order
4. Each level adds one more color to the sequence
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends and shows your final level
6. Click **"Play Again"** to restart the game

## 🎯 Game Features

- **Progressive Difficulty**: The sequence gets longer with each level
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons light up when activated
- **Level Tracking**: See your current level in real-time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Clean transitions and visual effects

The game features four colored buttons:
- 🟢 **Green** (top-left)
- 🔴 **Red** (top-right)
- 🟡 **Yellow** (bottom-left)
- 🔵 **Blue** (bottom-right)

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Sequence Generation**: Each level adds a random color to the sequence
2. **Sequence Playback**: The game displays the sequence with visual highlights
3. **Player Input**: Players click buttons to repeat the sequence
4. **Validation**: The game checks if the player's input matches the sequence
5. **Level Progression**: On success, the game advances to the next level
